# Pacman

Title: Pacman Variation
Contributers: Meenakshi Rama S (University of Maryland, College Park - Computer Science)

Project Description: Pacman Variation is a mini game with variations adapted from the real pacman. This game has three components (a pacman head, food, and ghost) which interact with one another according to user input.

Motivation: This project was completed as a part of my coursework for CMSC132 (Object-Oriented Programming 2). This specific project was unique in comparison to my other projects for this class because it did not follow a provided code distribution and had very minimal guidelines. Aside from the requirement of include specific nested class concepts discussed in class, students had the freedom to create any game they desired. I was inspired to code my own version of pacman as I enjoyed playing the game in my childhood. Though the components are rather simple I hope to create more complex characters in the future.

Running Project: To play this game it is recommended to download a recent version of Eclipse IDE (or another IDE such as VSCode capable of running java)

Project Design: This project uses only java but a majority of the nestec class characteristics are similar to other object-oriented programming languages. I coded this game via a class blueprint for the three characters n the game: pacman head, food, and ghost. Each of these characters and the entirety of the game rely of the Java graphcial interface's paint method. Each character was designed using a slidghtly different paint method and in the main driver the individual paint methods are called. The main driver instantiates each component once through a non-static initialization block. The game runs based on the main driver class's paint method which is called every 10th of a second.

Please reach out to me if you have trouble accessing my code or any other questions related to this game that you may have. Thank you!
